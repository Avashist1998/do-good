# Do-Good

## We want to gamify doing good.

### Description

The goal of the project is to create a platform that connects people who want to help with people who need help. The platform will be a web application that will allow users to create an account, find events to volunteer at, and create events for others to volunteer at, and track their volunteering efforts.
